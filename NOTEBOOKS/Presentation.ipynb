    "The scoring criteria which was to be used is the **Area under the Curve**. The AUC is a commonly used evaluation metric for binary classification problems such as the one we have here. The interpretation is that given a random positive observation and negative observation, the AUC gives the proportion of the time you guess which is correct. It is less affected by sample balance than accuracy. This is one reason we may use this ver something like a confusion matrix. A perfect model will score an AUC of 1, while random guessing will score an AUC of around 0.5, a meager 50% chance on each other. "
